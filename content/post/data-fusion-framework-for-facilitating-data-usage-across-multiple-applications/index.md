To support the analytics of our Data-Driven Transportation Analytics system, we have developed a Data Fusion Framework for facilitating data usage across multiple applications.\
This system is categorized into four major sections, with the first being data fusion. The data fusion module focuses on storing and combining data from various sources such as traffic data, parking data, goods transfer data, land use map data, OSRM map data, CDR data, GPS data, HVS data, satellite data, bus ticketing data, accident data and video data. Data sources are added to the Data Lake or Data warehouse.\
Apache Spark is used as an analytics engine. Data integration and warehouse management were done using standards, and APIs were provided for third-party access to the data. The data was then used to detect traffic congestion and applied as an approach to reduce congestion and facilitate ride-sharing among passengers in an effective manner. This data was also used to segment travelers based on their demographics, interests, and travel patterns.\
We have successfully developed the data fusion module, which is an integral part of the proposed infrastructure. The data collected is stored in a data warehouse, and the data fusion module uses this data to combine and create/optimize features, providing these fused data for further analysis.
